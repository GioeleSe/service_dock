# Service Dock  
A central web application designed to manage multiple services as sub-apps while serving as a learning platform for new technologies.  

## Frontend  
The initial UI will be minimal, with plans to enhance it using **TypeScript** and **React** for a more polished experience.  

## Backend  
The backend is built with **Flask-AppBuilder**, chosen for its simplicity, speed, and scalability.  

## ESP32 Integration  
For microcontroller development, **Platform.io** will be used instead of the Arduino IDE, as it provides a more complete and flexible development environment.
